## Why does this interest you:
### This video interests me because i didn't realize how much you could actally do with just CSS. Before this i was thinking you couldn't do lots of the features that are shown in the video, i thought you needed JS to activate the moving features. It's really cool to see the amount of different things you can really do with CSS. Another example of what i found really cool is what you can with just box shadows, If you go to (8:10) in the video to see what that guy has done is amazing. This video has really opened my eyes and made me realize what you really can do with JUST CSS.
